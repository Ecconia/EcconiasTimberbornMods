# EnhancedControls

Enhanced controls aims to take control of the keyboard shortcuts of the game and give it to the user.\
It is heavily inspired by the great [ToolShortcuts](https://github.com/zallek/TimberbornToolShortcuts) mod, but has a slightly different target experience.\
Hence awesome features like assigning keyboard shortcuts to tools and advanced tool switching will be added to this mod too.
